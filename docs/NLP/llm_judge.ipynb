    "\n",
    "**目的:** 使用大型语言模型（LLM）作为专家裁判，对比分析由不同模型生成的两份（或三份）金融报告的优劣。输入包括待比较的报告文件（Markdown 格式）和一个参考信息文件，输出 LLM 的详细对比评估。\n",

    "**用法:**\n",
    "1.  **设置 OpenAI API 密钥:** 确保 `OPENAI_API_KEY` 环境变量已设置，或者在下面的配置单元格中直接设置 `openai.api_key`。\n",
    "2.  **配置参数:** 在 \"配置参数\" 单元格中，设置报告文件路径 (`report_paths`)、参考文件路径 (`reference_path`)、要使用的 LLM 模型 (`model_name`) 和温度 (`temperature`)。\n",
    "3.  **运行单元格:** 按顺序执行所有单元格。评估结果将显示在最后一个单元格的输出中。\n"

Report 1 and Report 2 are similar in content, but differ slightly in presentation and depth. Report 1 offers a more concise analysis, while Report 2 provides additional details, particularly in the news analysis section. Both reports maintain internal consistency and logical flow, but Report 2's additional insights in the news analysis section give it a slight edge in analytical depth.\n",
